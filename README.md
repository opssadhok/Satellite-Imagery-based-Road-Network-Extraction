Here's a revised description for our model repository, including details about the use of HDF5 files, the CNN-based U-Net model, and performance measurement:

# Satellite Imagery-Based Road Network Extraction

This project involves developing a machine learning model to extract road networks from satellite images automatically. This capability is critical for creating detailed maps and providing accessibility information, particularly in disaster zones and developing countries, to enhance crisis response efforts.

# Project Overview

The model utilizes a CNN-based U-Net architecture to extract road network from satellite imagery. Given the large size of the dataset and limited computational power, HDF5 files are used to manage data efficiently.

# Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Training Images: 6226 RGB satellite images
- Validation Images: 1243 images
- Test Images: 1101 images (without masks)

Each image is paired with a grayscale mask where:
- White (255) represents road pixels
- Black (0) represents the background

Note: Mask values should be binarized at a threshold of 128. Labels might be less accurate in rural areas, with some small roads intentionally unannotated.

# Setup Instructions

1. **Define Dataset Path**:
   Update the dataset root folder path with your Google Drive location:
   dataset_root_folder = 'D:\\D- ops_sadhok\\train'
  
2. **Initialize MinMaxScaler**:
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
   minmaxscaler = MinMaxScaler()

3. **Create HDF5 Files**:
   Prepare HDF5 files for storing image and mask patches:
 
   import h5py
   with h5py.File('image_dataset.h5', 'w') as image_h5, h5py.File('mask_dataset.h5', 'w') as mask_h5:
       image_dataset = []
       mask_dataset = []
   ```

4. **Data Processing**:
   - Ensure reproducibility with a fixed random seed.
   - Randomly select an image index.
   - Extract and preprocess image and mask patches, removing any extra dimensions.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Display the satellite image.
   - Display the corresponding mask image.

6. **Load and Split Data**:
   - Load data from HDF5 files.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

7. **Model Architecture**:
   - Use a CNN-based U-Net model for road network extraction.

8. **Define Callbacks**:
  
   from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping

   checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('unet_model.keras', monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, save_best_only=True)
   early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, verbose=1)

9. **Train the Model**:
   Train the model using the training and validation datasets:
 
   history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                       validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
                       epochs=50,
                       batch_size=16,
                       callbacks=[checkpoint, early_stopping])
  

10. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
    - Evaluate the model on the validation set during training.
    - Test the model on the split training, validation, and test datasets.

11. **Model Testing**:
    - Load test data.
    - Make predictions on the test set.

12. **Visualization of Predictions**:
    - Randomly select an image index from the test set.
    - Display the original satellite image.
    - Display the predicted mask image.
